This is the pyweasel system. The system that no one asked for but we are doing for the fun of it. Also the system for which we could find no other name.

The requirements.txt files was generated by executing  pip freeze.py pyweasel/ as an alternative to uploading the usr/ local/ include/ bin/ directories, and preventing binary problems.
